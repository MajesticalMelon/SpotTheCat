        jaguars tend to be the bulkiest of their peers as they are one of the
        largest felines in the Americas! Their spots are very similar to those
        of a leopard but there are some key differences. The jaguar's spots in
        the middle of the body tend to be mostly connected rings and many times
        you can spot a tiny little dot within. They like to live in forested
        areas as well!

      <p>
        When compared to the other two big cats, cheetahs are very lean. They
        also only have dots as opposed to the ring-like shapes that can be found
        on both jaguars and leopards. One other stand-out feature is on the
        cheetah's face. They have lines that starts at their eyes and curve
        around to their mouth. cheetahs can usually be found in grasslands or
        desserts.

      <p>
        In terms of size, jaguars fall squarely in between the cheetah and the
        jaguar. While leopards have ring-like spots along their bodies, they are
        more disconnected and that signature tiny dot is usually not found. When
        compared to the jaguar the spots on its face also lean toward the
        smaller side. These guys live anywhere from deserts to forests and
        everything in-between.
